A Photo Renamer for after the holidays ;-)
==========================================

I was fed up with these cameras that are not able to name picture files in a clean way. This script roughly renames `.jpg` files after the date and hour they were shooted. 

DISCLAIMER: This script was written in less than one hour... If I were you, I wouldn't use it.
